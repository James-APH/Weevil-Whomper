# Weevil Whomper

This is the project I made for animation.

## Controls

The player can use the mouse to start and quit the game. The player must use
the arrow keys to controll the player.

## Gameplay

Initially I was going to have little weevils for the player to fight, but I ran
out of time. At the moment the game ends when the player reaches the x coord of 5000.

The background moves using Parallax, I animated the player's movement and did all
the art using Aseprite.

## Wishlist

I may add these in a new branch of the project, but if I were to have had more time
here's what I would have added.

- Weevils
- NPC with weapon, the player would do combat with their legs, so maybe steel
  toe boots
- Player health
